						<p>Problems? What? Are you out your mind? Do you nuts? Why you need that damn problem? You do not like peaceful thing?</p>
						<p>No, I really support the peacefull things, I was not trouble maker. This problem is connected with IT stuff, IT experience and research in IT world. The problem when I was windows user, I always deal with damn virus problem. Even, it's not guarantee, when every day updating the antivirus. Also when use anti adware, antispyware.</p>
						<p>So do little search, found this <a href="http://linuxhaters.blogspot.jp/2008/06/at-least-we-dont-have-any-viruses.html">page</a>. All I knew that he said, GNU/Linux is no need Antivirus. Because Linux is small market than Microsoft Windows. OK that's make senses. I quit (using windows)!.
						<br>
						When I decided to be very awesome and good guy with migrating to GNU/Linux, I really got a damn much problems, like my sound card laptop not working, cannot play .avi files, extremly, my wifi card can be used, only ethernet card that works. </p>
						<p>Honestly it consuming my resource though, but i never feel exhaust, and otherwise, it give me some curious feeling over and over again, and yeah, i don't think it useless to solve my problems.</p>
						<p>Many friend give some negative quotes:<q>Why you so hardening to use some difficult operating system?</q>, <q>Why you don't use a very very easy Operating System?, It only need to click setup, when you need install something. And many people use it</q>.<br>Yeah it's true that using Windows is easier, but I told you, I want to be safe. And knowing what application that runned, only use GNU/Linux you could felt those power.</p>
						<p>Also. Knowing the who has been developed GNU/Linux, inspired me to share my knowledge. And make me more sure about my path to be lecturer. And now as lecturer, I push my student use open document format to make report on their assignment. I don't accept other format. Like my lecture was, he push me using .doc and .ppt format. I think, it's fair enough if I push ny student now. It is not about free or paid. But it is about power that you have or not. What about you? Still using Microsoft Windows? Think again!</p>
